# regex-forms

### A library for effortlessy validating forms, and other inputs in javascript
At this time regex-forms is pretty simple, if you have any useful regex's to add please do so! I just added a few that i needed at a certain time. i will add more soon. 

## Examples:
```
const regforms = require("./regex-forms"); // ("regex-forms") if its in node_modules

regforms.validator.title("this should be a title);

//returns true or false if it meets the criteria
```

## To Do list:

* more regex's
* Event handling
* interacting with sockets directly
* ability to manipulate in more detail with the library itself
